    "    - if it is not the first container (it has a container underneath), cost estimation is highly decreased  if the crane want to pick it up (because it must be relocated in order to achieve goal)\n",
    "    - in the opposite scenario, cost estimation is highly increased, (as container 1 doesn't need to be moved)\n",
    "- container 2:  \n",
    "    - if it is on top of container 1 while 1 being in correct position, cost estimation is higly increased (as it is in the correct position and should not be moved further)\n",

    "\n",
    "by adding this extra layer of calculation, we make the heuristic calculation more precises for two reasons: \n",
    "- we allow the agent to instatly discard actions that are not leading closer to the goal.  \n",
    "- we allow the agent to understand when a move is beneficiary altough it is not instantly moving us closer to the goal, but it it necessary to find the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "I.e. take the scenario where the containers are stacked up like so: [1, 4, 2].  cont 2 has to be temporarly moved in order to clear cont 1, thus leading it further away from it. If we only performed the first calculation, the cost would increase becasue 2 is moving further away from 1.  but because we're perfoming the second set of calculations the agent is now capable of understanting that moving two, in this isntance, is a necessary move to reach the goal, so it is still seen as a promising path."
